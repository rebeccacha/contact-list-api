<h1>Contact List Home</h1>
<h3>REST Resources</h3>
Resource descriptions: {domain}/ContactList/rest/{path}<br>
E.g. Retrieve all contacts: GET http://localhost:8080/ContactList/rest/contact/<br>
<br>

<h3>Project Progress</h3>
Unit testing not complete.<br>
Resource paths tested with the Postman Google Chrome extension.<br>
There were sometimes problems in Postman if the Content-Type HTTP header value was present instead of absent.<br>
<br>
The "Create" action uses the POST HTTP method and can be tested with an <a href="./NewContact.html">HTML form</a> with a file-upload field.  The "Update" action uses the PUT method and cannot be created through HTML alone.<br>
<br>
Data is assumed to be correctly formatted.<br>
Parameters should be able to be excluded to create null values in the database.<br>
The PUT (update) method replaces the entire contact record, not just single fields. <br>
Poorly formatted input is not well-checked and may cause the application to crash. <br>
<br>
Searches are currently case-sensitive.<br>
